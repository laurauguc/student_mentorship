# Mentoring Notes

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository is a collection of notes, tips, and resources Iâ€™ve shared with students to support their growth in data science. Topics include Python best practices, version control with Git and GitHub, and general advice for writing clean, organized, and well-documented code.

Whether you're just getting started or looking to level up your skills, I hope you find something helpful here.
